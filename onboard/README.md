## Installation
* Clone this repository
* From the repo directory, run ```git submodule update --init```
* Install PlatformIO IDE (addon for VSCode)
* From the PlatformIO libraries tab, install “ArduinoJson” by Benoit Blanchon and “BasicLinearAlgebra” by Tom Stewart
* Use the "Upload" feature of PlatformIO to upload the firmware to the Teensy
* The last two steps are covered by this video: https://knowledge.autodesk.com/community/screencast/cbf5a477-08e8-4b54-aa1b-aeffc3e5aa3d 
* If it's working, the Teensy should blink for 5s on bootup and then start printing debug info over Serial
